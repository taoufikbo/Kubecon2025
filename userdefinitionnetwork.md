# Deep Dive into User-Defined Networks (UDN) and the OVN-Kubernetes CNI Plugin for OpenShift Container Platform

## Introduction

The **User-Defined Network (UDN)** is an important networking concept used in **OpenShift** to allow fine-grained control over pod-to-pod communication. It is particularly relevant when using the **OVN-Kubernetes** CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin, which is designed to provide scalable and efficient networking for Kubernetes clusters, including those running on OpenShift. This deep dive explores how UDNs work within OpenShift, how they integrate with the OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin, and the benefits they offer in managing Kubernetes networking.

## What is OVN-Kubernetes?

**OVN-Kubernetes** is an implementation of the **Open Virtual Network (OVN)** designed to integrate with **Kubernetes**. OVN is an open-source virtual networking platform that provides network virtualization for various environments, including data centers and Kubernetes clusters. 

OVN-Kubernetes serves as a **CNI plugin** for Kubernetes (and OpenShift), providing the following key features:

- **Network segmentation**: Offers network policies, load balancing, and network isolation between pods.
- **Scalability**: Supports large-scale Kubernetes deployments, using the **OVS (Open vSwitch)** backend.
- **IPv6 support**: Full support for IPv6 networks, providing flexibility for modern cloud-native applications.
- **High availability**: Provides mechanisms to ensure network resiliency and high availability.

## User-Defined Networks (UDN)

A **User-Defined Network (UDN)** is a feature in Kubernetes/OpenShift that allows users to define custom networks for their pods, beyond the default network that Kubernetes assigns. This feature is often useful in scenarios where:

- **Network isolation** is required between different workloads.
- Custom **network policies** need to be applied to certain workloads.
- Fine-grained control over **IP allocation** is necessary for specific use cases.

### Key Features of UDN

- **Isolation**: Provides the ability to isolate network traffic between pods belonging to different UDNs.
- **Network Customization**: Allows the definition of specific network settings such as IP addresses, DNS settings, and routes.
- **Enhanced Security**: Helps create network boundaries for sensitive workloads or multi-tenant environments.

In OpenShift, UDNs can be implemented using the **OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin**, allowing for seamless integration with Kubernetes networking while providing flexibility for more complex network configurations.

## How OVN-Kubernetes and UDN Work Together

### OVN-Kubernetes CNI Plugin Architecture

The OVN-Kubernetes CNI plugin configures network connectivity between containers and pods using **Open vSwitch** (OVS), enabling network virtualization. The integration with Kubernetes or OpenShift allows it to enforce **network policies** and create custom network setups.

When combined with UDN, OVN-Kubernetes allows users to create and manage custom networks in a Kubernetes/OpenShift environment, which results in:

1. **Network Policies**: OVN-Kubernetes enables network policy enforcement based on UDNs, allowing for isolation and control of pod-to-pod traffic.
2. **IP Addressing**: OVN-Kubernetes automatically assigns IP addresses to pods within UDNs and ensures proper routing between different networks.
3. **Overlay Networks**: OVN uses overlay networking techniques to connect pods within UDNs and across multiple nodes within the cluster.

### UDN Configuration with OVN-Kubernetes

- **Pod Network Interface (PNI)**: Pods that are part of a UDN get their network interface connected to a user-defined bridge or virtual network.
- **MACVLAN/Bridge**: OVN supports multiple network interface types, allowing the UDN
